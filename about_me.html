                    <p>Hello, hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Lyndon Alexander de la Torre. I majored in Computer Science in the University of California, Irvine and was a proud member of the Video Game Development Club.</p>
                    <p>I design, program, and lead a variety of team projects. I hope to one day work as a software engineer as either a gameplay programmer or a full-stack developer. As a game developer, I mainly use Unity & C#. I also use Unreal Engine 4 & Godot for small game jam projects.</p>
                    <p>I like making fast paced, hectic games as these are the games that my friend groups play and share. They are also often have simple concepts, have room for twists and innovations, and just enjoyable to make.</p>
                    <p>Besides programming games and designing website, I'm also up to a lot of shenanigans. I usually like playing single player games such as Super Mario Odyssey, Persona 5 Royal, Sly Cooper, and Red Dead Redemption. Besides games, I've taken the hobbies of playing flute and gardening.</p>
